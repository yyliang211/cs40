Example of restoring an iamge:
make
./restoration ./alum-corrupt.pgm > alum.pgm

We received much help from the comp40 TAs during office hours. First week we 
discussed with the TAs about the design and the second week they assisted us 
with the debugging process. Namely, when we received help from Alex, Tina, and
Ann Marie during office hours.

Readaline functionally reads in one line of the plain pgm and restoration 
recovers the original plain pgm by returning the digit bytes in the raster. 
After getting the raster in decimal we print it to stdout as a char to convert
to binary with all the header information. 

Future improvements:
Rhe images that have issues are sail.pgm, turing.pgm, and professor.pgm. 
We think that this is due to the condition statement that we set in order to 
separate a line of the row into the digit bytes and the non digit bytes. 
There are probably terminating charactersinfused. Additionally, we have 
memory leakages due to not freeing the data structures.

Validate is used to check if the P5 format is good via pnmrdr interface.

We worked on the assignment for about 40 hours.
