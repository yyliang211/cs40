We received much help from the comp40 TAs during office hours. First week we 
discussed with the TAs about the design and the second week they assisted us 
with the debugging process. Namely, when we received help from Alex, Tina, and
Ann Marie during office hours.

Readaline functionally reads in one line of the plain pgm and restoration 
recovers the original plain pgm by returning the digit bytes in the raster. 
After getting the raster in decimal we print it to stdout as a char to convert
to binary with all the header information. However, there are cases where the 
image is not correctly outputed. For example, the images that have issues are 
sail.pgm, turing.pgm, and professor.pgm. We think that this is due to the 
condition statement that we set in order to separate a line of the row into the
digit bytes and the non digit bytes. There are probably terminating characters
infused. Additionally, we did not free the memory in the heap and thus have
major memory leakages.

We worked on the assignment for about 40 hours.
